    <h2>STORYTELLING</h2>
    <p>
    The cocktail dates back to the early 19th century, and its name comes from the "old- fashioned" way it was originally made. It was first created at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky, in the 1880s, though variations of it had been around for years before. Over time, the Old Fashioned became a staple in bars across the world, particularly gaining popularity in the mid-20th century. The Old Fashioned is often associated with classic cocktail culture and remains a favorite for those who enjoy strong, spirit-forward drinks. Its balanced, bittersweet flavor and rich history make it a go-to choice for cocktail enthusiasts.

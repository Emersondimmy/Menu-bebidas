    <h2>STORYTELLING</h2>
    <p>
      The Dirty Martini is a classic cocktail that emerged in the early 20th century. It’s a variation of the traditional Martini, made by adding a splash of olive brine to the gin and dry vermouth mix. The drink is said to have been popularized in the 1940s, with various stories claiming different bartenders as its inventor. One popular theory is that it was created at the Martini Room in New York, or possibly by bartender Frank Meier at the Ritz in Paris. The "dirty" element comes from the olive brine, giving the cocktail a savory twist, and it has since become a favorite for those who enjoy a briny, bold taste in their martinis.
